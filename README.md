# Guess the Upvotes

How good are you at guessing the number of upvotes of comments from the top 100 Askreddit submissions? Test your skills!

The aim of the game is to try to guess the number of upvotes of 5 random comments from the top 100 Askreddit submissions. The closer your guess, the more points you get per round. You are scored out of 100 per round, normalized based on the score of the comment you are shown. 

Best of luck!
